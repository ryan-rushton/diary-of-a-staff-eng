# (WIP) Well here we are

So as the README states, I recently got promoted to the title of staff engineer. Normally I would say that I don't care much for titles, but I feel more proud, humbled, and also more intimidated than I expected to be.

Proud because anyone who knows me knows that I changed careers to get into software and it wasn't an easy road. I never expected to go this far, this quickly, in this career that I love.

Humbled because I am here due to the recognition of my peers, whom I hold in high regard. I wasn't actually planning to apply for this promotion and I even pushed back on it, my peers talked me into it. That fact alone, that they pushed me to do this, is extraordinarily humbling.

Scared because only since it became Slack official, have I realised the weight that the title also brings. I can no longer be that senior engineer with loud opinions, that is just trying to get shit done. Whether I like it or not, my title means that people will listen more carefully to what I have to say, and as such, I need to put more effort into leading by example.

So now with the soppy stuff out of the way, let's reflect, then get to the more interesting part. How has this changed my perspective, the way I think, and what I perceive my role to be.

## Reflections

I was promoted in the company, not by switching jobs, so that means I have effectively been doing the job of a staff engineer for some time now. While I was doing the job needed for the recognition, I definitely wasn't considering myself a staff engineer. I considered myself to be the engineer making sure projects got done.

So what was I doing to make sure that happened? Largely I was being the glue that my teams and projects needed at the time. I didn't know glue was a defined thing in our industry at the time, but my implicit understanding of it was close (listen to [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cr2Yn_MrKg) great talk by Tanya Reily on being glue).

More concretely I was
1. Estimating and defining work to be done
1. Communicating and managing up with stakeholders, including pushing back on scope creep where it made sense
1. Ensuring engineers were aligned across projects
1. Picking up on gaps in either product, design or engineering
1. Mentoring and giving feedback
1. Writing the code no one else wanted to write
1. Managing the tech debt we were accumulating due to timeline constraints

Honestly, none of this was particularly glamorous work but it needed to be done for the project I was on. A project that was rushed, expected to fail, but also deemed to be vital for the company's position in the market.

Now that I am on the other side of this, I am now looking back on the work I did and what we achieved with a different perspective.

## Areas I realise I need to work on

### Leadership

This is the one thing that I have never really put too much effort into myself. I always considered myself a doer, more than a leader. Never a follower, but more of an independent agent who looked for problems to solve. I always cared about my team, but also ventured outside of it to find interesting problems I cared about.

Now I don't think I have a choice. Given how hard it is perceived to reach the staff+ roles, people are going to listen more to what I have to say and define their own understanding of the more opinionated technical concerns based off that.

This brings with it a responsibility that I hadn't really considered before. It is distinct from mentoring, as from mentoring you have time to flesh out opinions, discuss why you hold those opinions, and push the mentee to find cracks and form their view if they disagree. I no longer have that luxury I believe.

In saying this, leadership is also something that cannot be taken for granted. It can effectively be taken away if I lose the trust of the more senior engineers and my managers around me. I am not a free agent who can promote whatever opinion I like the most. It is something that needs to be aligned with not only the organisation but more importantly the leadership team above and around me. I have realised that being a leader is as much as being a follower.

### Communication

Something else that I have never put too much effort into that I now feel like I have a responsibility to improve upon. Short, blunt, and to the point is something I have always valued in communication, along with having a bit of fun. A meme here and there. 

I think these things are all still going to be hallmarks of how I communicate with those close to me but I plan to change how I communicate in a more public manner. When I write something in a public Slack channel, I will make an effort to make sure it is well reasoned, addressing edges and gaps, so that my words cannot be taken in the wrong way.

I also don't believe I am a strong writer, so I suppose this diary or blog is the start of working to improve that. Our CTO is a fabulous writer, so I plan to pay more attention to how he writes, to see what parts I can use to make my writing more effective.

## I read engineering books now

This has prompted me to pick up reading engineering books, after a long time of reading nothing. I am starting with Will Larson's [Staff Engineer](https://staffeng.com/book). 

Largely with this first book, I am looking to learn what this role means to other staff engineers, and I realise the role is both different and similar to so many folks. Hopefully, it will spark some ideas and be a start for my self-guidance to be the engineer that I want to be.

Next up I plan to read something on system design, likely [Designing Data Intensive Applications](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781491903063/) as while it is apparently quite low level, many see it as a classic for the current time. In general, I think system design is something I am passionate/interested in, but have done very little intentional education on.

Largely, I put this section here as I have realised I need to get out of my comfort zone and start learning things that will make me more effective in guiding others. Books I think will be my first attempt at that. I would love to go back to university, but I don't see the same value for time investment in doing that. Maybe I can when I have more spare time.

## I probably need to write less code

I love writing code. Technically I am a frontend engineer in my current company but I love all code, even the bad languages, even SQL. I do it when I have energy in my spare time, and maybe that hobby code will become my main avenue for doing so, time will tell.

In the last few weeks of my time as a senior engineer, I have written a whole bunch of code not because it was the most impactful thing I could be doing, but because it felt good and has a fast feedback cycle. It felt like I achieved something for me and my team in a matter of hours.

Going forward, I don't think this is going to be the most valuable thing I could be doing. As such, I will put effort into figuring out what is more impactful and do that instead. 

I will still be making technical contributions, but they will be in the form of design docs, and proposals, through mentoring and helping engineers, in proof of concepts to scope out work for my team and my group. I think there will still be some time to write code in there, but it won't be the big satisfying pull requests that solve hard problems or improve architecture.

## So what type of staff eng do I want to be

I think this could likely be its own file, and maybe in time, I will do that. At the moment though I don't know. 

From reading Will Larson's book, I will likely fill the Tech Lead archetype for some time, and that is fine as I can see myself doing that and enjoying it. But is that where I want to stay? Do I even want to focus on getting really good at a single archetype, or do I want to be flexible so I can fill the role that the organisation and my leadership team need at the time? The second of those appeals to me, but is also daunting as it means being at least good at several roles that I have no idea if I am cut out for.

Realistically I need time to figure this out, the next 6 months will be filled with considering this point. What is clear to me is that I love software engineering and want to give back to the profession, and what it gives me. I know I can do that by building up good engineers and using the things I have learned. So I might start there.
